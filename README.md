The collected data from a survey of 70 individuals presents a concerning picture of harassment prevalence, with a significant majority having experienced verbal and physical harassment. It also highlights a substantial gap in support-seeking behaviour post-harassment, with more than half of the affected individuals choosing not to seek help. For those who did, friends and family were the primary source of support. Satisfaction with the received support was moderately rated by the largest group of respondents, but the overall satisfaction spectrum indicates a diversity in the quality or effectiveness of the support systems in place. This survey underscores the importance of accessible and effective support mechanisms for individuals who experience harassment.

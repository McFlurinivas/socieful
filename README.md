The collected data from a survey of 70 individuals presents a concerning picture of harassment prevalence, with a significant majority having experienced verbal and physical harassment. It also highlights a substantial gap in support-seeking behaviour post-harassment, with more than half of the affected individuals choosing not to seek help. For those who did, friends and family were the primary source of support. Satisfaction with the received support was moderately rated by the largest group of respondents, but the overall satisfaction spectrum indicates a diversity in the quality or effectiveness of the support systems in place. This survey underscores the importance of accessible and effective support mechanisms for individuals who experience harassment.

Download Socieful directly from this repository. There are two folders:
 - chatgpt_server folder contains the logic behind the chatbot in app.py.
 - Socieful_app folder contains the code for the app in lib folder which is properly coded for readability.

### Prerequisites üìù

Before you start, make sure you have installed the following on your system:

- Flutter SDK
- VS Code
- Dart and Flutter extensions for VS Code
- Android emulator or physical device
- Python (optional)

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

- Clone the Socieful repository.
- Open the project folder in VS Code.
- In VS Code, open the command palette (View > Command Palette) and type "Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor". This will check your system to make sure everything is set up correctly.

  #### To Setup the Virtual Environment for ChatGPT server
  - Navigate to **chatgpt_server** folder
  - Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash

  #### Setting up the ChatGPT API
  - Create an OpenAI secret key by visiting the following link: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

    ```
    Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.
  - Start the server by running this command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
  #### Configure the Flutter App
  - Open the file **Socieful_app/lib/providers/chat_page/server_communication_provider.dart** and replace the existing URL with the URL generated when you started the server. For example:
    ```bash
    final String _serverUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000';
    ```

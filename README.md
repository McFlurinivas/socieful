      <p> The survey conducted on harassment experiences reveals a significant portion of the respondents have encountered some form of harassment, with 58.6% affirming they have experienced it. A smaller, yet notable, fraction of the population, 24.3%, confidently states they have not faced harassment. Meanwhile, 17.1% of participants express ambivalence, choosing 'Maybe,' which may imply conditional instances of harassment or uncertainty in defining their experiences. This data underscores the prevalence of harassment in various forms and suggests a need for further research and discussion on this critical issue. </p>

<p>The collected data from a survey of 70 individuals presents a concerning picture of harassment prevalence, with a significant majority having experienced verbal and physical harassment. It also highlights a substantial gap in support-seeking behaviour post-harassment, with more than half of the affected individuals choosing not to seek help. For those who did, friends and family were the primary source of support. Satisfaction with the received support was moderately rated by the largest group of respondents, but the overall satisfaction spectrum indicates a diversity in the quality or effectiveness of the support systems in place. This survey underscores the importance of accessible and effective support mechanisms for individuals who experience harassment.</p>
